First Machine Learning Project - Step by Step with comments

# For this first ML I've used the codes and content from this amazing google notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P9DJIDsaTosUkdSNDHCLb-aHLX4LMk56#scrollTo=ELKgT4IAKOIk
<br>

I've add some personal observations and content in order to make more sense for me. Hope it can help beginners like me to understand this complex but fascinating world of ML.
<br>
Contributions in code or explanation of the concepts are more than welcome! Let's learn together!
